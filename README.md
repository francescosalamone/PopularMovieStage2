The second excercise of the Android Developer Nanodegree Program by Udacity

##Configuration
Before install you should create the "theMovieDbAPI.xml" ander the res\values folder.

Inside this xml file you have to save a string resource called "apiv3" and value as your ApiKey.

##Where can you take the Api Key?
To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from [themoviedb.org](www.themoviedb.org).
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
