# Popular Movie Stage 2 project


The third exercise of the Android Developer Nanodegree Program by Udacity

## Configuration
Before install you should write the api key on your gradle.properties under the root folder.

Inside the gradle.properties file you have to save a string called "apiV3" and value as your ApiKey, in this format:
apiV3="Here_My_Movie_DB_Api_Key"

## Where can you take the Api Key?
To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from [themoviedb.org](www.themoviedb.org).
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
